# Kind Sir

Kind Sir is a [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) satellite project.
It allows to automatically accept merge requests which got
specific number of upvotes during the code review.

Kind Sir is written in Scala and using Akka library heavily.

# How it works
Application reads config file and grabs a list of groups from Gitlab API to monitor.
The separate supervisor actor will be spawned for each group.
Once per minute groups' supervisor spawns Repo Worker actor for each repository in
this group.

Repo worker tries to find `.kind_sir.conf` file in the root of repository.
If there is no such file, worker will stop and repository will not
be processed. Otherwise Repo Worker will read this file and will grab a list of
opened Merge Requests from repository. After that it will check the number of
upvotes and downvotes for every merge request. And if request has
enought upvotes and meets the requirements of Veto settings, Repo Worker will try to
merge it.

## Installation

- Git clone this repository
- Run `activator assembly` inside the repository directory
- Grab `.jar` file produced by the `assembly` command
from `target/scala-2.11/` directory
- Deploy this file to the target system
- Create Gitlab user on behalf of whom Kind Sir will be acting
- Add this user to any number of groups, which you want to be monitored by Kind Sir
- Find `private_token` of this user in Gitlab's profile section
- Create configuration file described below
- Run `java -Dconfig.file=<your-config.con> <kind-sir-assembly.jar>`

## Configuration

Kind Sir uses two kinds of configuration files:
1. Application configuration file, deployed with Kind Sir itself
2. Acceptance policy configuration placed in the root
of monitored repository

### Application configuration file format

App configuration file is just a normal [Lightbend Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/) file.
There are only two fields you can specify at server side:
1. Gitlab URL
2. Private Token for a user on whose behalf Kind Sir will be
acting.

For example, you create `config.conf` with this content:

```
kindSir {
  gitlab-url = "https://gitlab.acme.com"
  gitlab-token = "ex_MT1jP5t1DeSnN4ka9"
}
```

After that you can run Kind Sir with command:
```
java -Dconfig.file=config.conf kind-sir-assembly-0.1.jar
```

### Acceptance policy

You should place config file named `.kind_sir.conf` in the root of
every repository you want to be monitored by Kind Sir.
This is a regular JSON file.

You can find an example of this file right in this repository.

```

There are also only two things to specify:
1. If number of upvotes minus number of downvotes exceed specified number,
request will be merged
2. "Veto enabled" flag. True value means request will never be accepted if
there is at least one downvote.

Example:
```
{
  "upvotes_threshold": 2,
  "veto_enabled": false
}
```
